A serveral day ago, I deposited about 15.5eth to their exchange platform and plan to stored there, bitfinex do not require my any personal privary identidication.
but when I trying to withdraw back to my wallet, it require much of my personal privary identidication, only I intend to withdraw to my origin wallet, it is blocked by bitfinex and restrict my account, all action are blocked. But i think if you require my identification, you must show me before my depositing!!!
And identification vertification is ok, but why do you need so much personal information?? It is my personal privacy information, it is my right. I can never believe facebook can maintain my personal privacy security, and you? I can trust u??
Bitfinex's after deposited withdraw request require your personal privary identidication, such as International Passport, National ID, Drivers License , Proof of Address Document (issued by the Government) , Bank Statement (most recent - black out any irrelevant information) , Personal Address, Bank Document, personal photo ....and more , why huobi . okex . poloniex do not need must of these?? It is my personal privacy information, it is my right!!
so , do not use bitfinex please!!
